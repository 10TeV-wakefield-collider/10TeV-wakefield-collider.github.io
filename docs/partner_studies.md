# Collaboration
The 10 TeV Wakefield Collider Design Study is one of several studies aiming to develop a design for future collider based on wakefield technology. There is frequent cross-collaboration between the design studies.

## Partner Studies

### HALHF

The HALHF design study is developing a concept for an asymmetric Higgs Factory using beam-driven plasma accelertion to generate high energy electron beams which collide with lower-energy positron beams from an RF accelerator.

### ALiVE

The ALiVE design study is developing a concept for a single-stage, proton beam-driven plasma scheme for accelerating electron and positron beams for a Higgs Factory and other collider concepts. ALiVE is based on technology that is currently being developed by the AWAKE experiment at CERN

The ALEGRO study group coordinated collider design efforts across several technologies including beam and laser driven plasma acceleration, and beam and laser driven structure-based acceleration. ALEGRO was created by the ICFA Advanced and Novel Accelerators panel and holds a yearly workshop.

Linear Collider Vision (LC Vision) brings together proponents and supporters of all kinds of Linear Collider projects, in order to discuss common topics, to develop a united perspective on the long-term evolution of a Linear Collider Facility, and to propose such a facility for CERN.
