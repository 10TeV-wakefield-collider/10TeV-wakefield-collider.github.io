# Overview

This is a plan for a Design Study of a 10 TeV parton-center-of-mass (pCM)
collider based on **wakefield accelerator** (WFA) technology.

The initiative is sparked by the [2023 US P5 Report](https://www.usparticlephysics.org/2023-p5-report/), but it is a **global** undertaking. We will collaborate with on-going design efforts, including [ALEGRO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03968v2) and [HALHF](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/acf395), and contribute to the [LC Vision](https://agenda.linearcollider.org/event/10134/contributions/54223/attachments/39808/62901/LCvision_jlist_lcws2024_240711.pdf) program.

This is an HEP-wide community effort. The study requires input from:

- HEP Theorists
- Detector Physicists
- Accelerator Physicists with experience in Linear Collider design
- Advanced Accelerator Researchers
